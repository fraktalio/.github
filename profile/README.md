## Domain modeling

[Domain modeling](https://fraktalio.com/domain-modeling) is a powerful tool for clarifying and refining our understanding of a subject area, and for identifying opportunities for optimization and improvement. By carefully considering the needs of stakeholders and the nature of the domain, it is possible to create effective and useful models that can facilitate communication and drive progress.
